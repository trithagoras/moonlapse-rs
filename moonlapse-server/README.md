## Building and running

```

This will build both the shared library `moonlapse-shared` and start the server.

### Client

**(coming soon)**

From the root directory, simply run:
```sh
cargo run -p moonlapse-client
```

This will build both the shared library `moonlapse-shared` and start the client.
